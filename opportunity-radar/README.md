# Opportunity Radar (Apps Script)

Provides a custom menu in Google Sheets with "KSE Tools → Refresh Opportunities". Populates the `Opportunities` sheet using stubbed data fetchers and a placeholder scoring function.

## Getting Started
1. Open Google Sheets and attach this script (Apps Script).
2. Deploy as add-on or bind script to the Sheet.
3. Use the menu "KSE Tools → Refresh Opportunities".

## TODO
- Integrate real sources (UrlFetchApp) and parsers.
- Add OAuth/API keys via Properties Service.
- Improve scoring model (AI/heuristics).
